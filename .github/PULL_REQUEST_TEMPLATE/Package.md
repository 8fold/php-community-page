**Link to the package**
Packages tend to focus on solving a specific problem and tends to leverage more libraries, packages, and components than a low-level library. 

For example, [Commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark) is a package because it renders Markdownâ€”that's all it does. Also, PHP Unit could be classified as a package because it does one thing well (testing); however, that is not how the maintainers identify it. Therefore, it would be a framework.
